# Fitness Tracker Website: MetricFit
CodeJam 15 project by Wonton Warriors. 

## Our objective
Our motivation for building this project came from the idea that people are more likely to stay consistent when they can directly see the progress they have made. We wanted to create a platform that makes tracking progress feel visual, motivating, and clear, so that users can stay inspired as they consistently strive towards their goals.

We want to create an intuitive space where users can:
* Update their physical metrics
* Log their workout activity
* See precisely how much progress they are making in terms of calories burned
* Stay engaged through daily streaks and a leaderboard

## Features
Users create their accounts with encrypted passwords and input their physical metrics after account registration. MetricFit combines the user’s logged exercises and daily activity with physical body metrics to calculate the calories burned for the day. 

Users can track their fitness journey each day on the website’s built-in weekly calendar. It helps the user visualize:
* On which days were they most active
* Where they have been picking up momentum
* How consistently they have been exercising over the week

The platform incorporates a streak system to reward the user for showing up each day. Watching their exercise streak can give them extra motivation to stay committed to their fitness.

Users can see the Leaderboard to compare progress, challenge each other, and stay accountable. The social aspect and the friendly competitive nature can keep the experience encouraging and motivating.
